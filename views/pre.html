<h2>Pre-Render Example</h2>

<p>This page uses the new YUI/Express <strong>middleware</strong> for "pre-rendering".</p>
<p>As you will note in the code below, during the request we will call <code>res.render()</code> on the
file passed into the middleware. Then create a <code>YUI</code> instance from that layout and attach
it to the res/req objects. This allows you to have an active DOM inside your request handler.</p>
